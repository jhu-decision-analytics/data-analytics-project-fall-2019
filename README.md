# Decisions Analytics Project Title
2-3 sentences that explain your business/research/industry question and some high-level findings and suggestions. This is like the abstract of your executive summary. Tell the reader a little bit about your question, why this is important, a high-level finding, and the future implications of your findings. This can include some statistics, but shouldn’t dive deep into specifics about your analysis. Make this short and captivating so that the user wants to continue reading about this topic and what you’ve done. You can use bullet points in this section to emphasize some key points or findings that are further explained in the: 
 - Challenge/problem section 
 - Solution section 
 - Suggestion section
But make sure to surround the bullets with additional context for what the reader is about to encounter in your summary.
